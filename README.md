# 📩 Spam Detection using Naive Bayes

This project is a Machine Learning based Spam Detection System that classifies SMS messages as Spam or Not Spam (Ham) using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and the Naive Bayes algorithm.

The model is trained on an SMS dataset and achieves approximately **98% accuracy**.

## 🧠 Algorithm Used

**Naive Bayes (MultinomialNB)**

Naive Bayes is widely used for text classification problems such as spam filtering because it works efficiently with word frequency features and probabilistic predictions.

---

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset contains SMS messages labeled as:

- Spam
- Ham (Not Spam)

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
